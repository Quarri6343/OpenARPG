# Turns Minecraft into an Isometric View ARPG

### This mod has the following features:

・Click to Move, Fight and Loot  
・GUI and HUD by ModernUI  
・Press F5 to switch back to First Person View (for world editing purpose)  

### It will have the following features:

・New combat system, loot system and crafting system inspired by classic ARPGs  
・A system to load user made campaign world which contains story line, terrains and enemy spawn points (called "Acts" in those games)  

The development is still in the early alpha stage, any feedback or contribution via github issues are welcome  

### Compatibility

・This mod removes "mining" and "building" feature from minecraft entirely, so you can't play it with any tech mod, magic mod or exploration mod  
・Of course, it also crashes with camera-related mods  
・I have not tested it with optimization mods yet
